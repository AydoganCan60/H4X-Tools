# Contributing
Volunteer developers are highly needed, as I am the only developer keeping this project alive currently. New tools are always welcome.

Keep an eye at the [projects](https://github.com/users/vil/projects/2) and [issues](https://github.com/vil/H4X-Tools/issues) page to see if there is anything specific to do.

## Submitting changes
After you have forked the project and done your changes. Open an pull request and tell what you have changed, improved or added.

Also avoid using AI, human written code is always better.

Don't also write **random** commit messages, simply tell shortly what you have done.

Thank you for reading.
